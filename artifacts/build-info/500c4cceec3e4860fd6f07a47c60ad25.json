Skips emitting an {Approval} event indicating an allowance update. This is not required by the ERC. See {xref-ERC20-_approve-address-address-uint256-bool-}[_approve]. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/token_shop/MyTokenShopERC20.sol\":\"MyTokenShopERC20\"},\"evmVersion\":\"osaka\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts@5.2.0/access/AccessControl.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xa0e92d42942f4f57c5be50568dac11e9d00c93efcb458026e18d2d9b9b2e7308\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://46326c0bb1e296b67185e81c918e0b40501b8b6386165855df0a3f3c634b6a80\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmTwyrDYtsxsk6pymJTK94PnEpzsmkpUxFuzEiakDopy4Z\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts@5.2.0/access/IAccessControl.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xc1c2a7f1563b77050dc6d507db9f4ada5d042c1f6a9ddbffdc49c77cdc0a1606\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fd54abb96a6156d9a761f6fdad1d3004bc48d2d4fce47f40a3f91a7ae83fc3a1\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmUrFSGkTDJ7WaZ6qPVVe3Gn5uN2viPb7x7QQ35UX4DofX\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts@5.2.0/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x880da465c203cec76b10d72dbd87c80f387df4102274f23eea1f9c9b0918792b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://399594cd8bb0143bc9e55e0f1d071d0d8c850a394fb7a319d50edd55d9ed822b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbPZzgtT6LEm9CMqWfagQFwETbV1ztpECBB1DtQHrKiRz\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts@5.2.0/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x6ef9389a2c07bc40d8a7ba48914724ab2c108fac391ce12314f01321813e6368\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b7a5cb39b1e6df68f4dd9a5e76e853d745a74ffb3dfd7df4ae4d2ace6992a171\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPbzKR19rdM8X3PLQjsmHRepUKhvoZnedSR63XyGtXZib\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts@5.2.0/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe06a3f08a987af6ad2e1c1e774405d4fe08f1694b67517438b467cecf0da0ef7\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://df6f0c459663c9858b6cba2cda1d14a7d05a985bed6d2de72bd8e78c25ee79db\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeTTxZ7qVk9rjEv2R4CpCwdf8UMCcRqDNMvzNxHc3Fnn9\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts@5.2.0/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x70f2f713b13b7ce4610bcd0ac9fec0f3cc43693b043abcb8dc40a42a726eb330\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c13d13304ac79a83ab1c30168967d19e2203342ebbd6a9bbce4db7550522dcbf\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeN5jKMN2vw5bhacr6tkg78afbTTZUeaacNHqjWt4Ew1r\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts@5.2.0/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts@5.2.0/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xddce8e17e3d3f9ed818b4f4c4478a8262aab8b11ed322f1bf5ed705bb4bd97fa\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://8084aa71a4cc7d2980972412a88fe4f114869faea3fefa5436431644eb5c0287\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmbqfs5dRdPvHVKY8kTaeyc65NdqXRQwRK7h9s5UJEhD1p\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts@5.2.0/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x79796192ec90263f21b464d5bc90b777a525971d3de8232be80d9c4f9fb353b8\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f6fda447a62815e8064f47eff0dd1cf58d9207ad69b5d32280f8d7ed1d1e4621\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmfDRc7pxfaXB2Dh9np5Uf29Na3pQ7tafRS684wd3GLjVL\"]},\"contracts/token_shop/MyTokenShopERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x9a906066f0167ac3a4bb005e55aa9a13d9bb5c03b348300366f98e1d7e997ace\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://896112a017b895cb60810fb40110ce5d0f0422aa81b44464ae46d24b1e040921\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qme5NfUBLHSubf1pcgwAQYcBqy4mDk4shiv91GuatUSuDB\"]}},\"version\":1}",

								"text": " @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access\n control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```solidity\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```solidity\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}\n to enforce additional security measures for this role."
